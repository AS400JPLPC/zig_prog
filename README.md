# zig_prog
Hello,
testing the Gensrc program from Zig_Termcurs.

ex:
Please retrieve the source formSrc.zig and insert it into ????. zig then adapt as required.

Look at the source formTest.zig.
And compare with formSrc.zig.

It's all very simple.

Ps: it's not finished yet, the SQL module has yet to be inserted, and the interactive transactions have yet to be packaged.
